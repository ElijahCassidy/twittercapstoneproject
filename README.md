# twittercapstoneproject
In this project, we will create a:
1. Visual layout
1. Feed formatting
1. Buttons/menus
1. Color, spacing, and readability

for our class' twitter project called "Y" (it was originally named "JA", which our teacher's name reversed).

## File Key

### Main Files:
- **"!!!most_updated_version"** contains the full code for a twitter clone to help us figure out how the graphics should look.
